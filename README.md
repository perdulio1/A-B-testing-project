# Marketing A/B Test: From Statistical Success to Economic Reality

###  Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of the existing dataset, but with a key difference: it includes a 'legend' about the cost per impression and profit per conversion. I did this in order to turn a regular dataset into a full-fledged scenario, and to be able to make business conclusions or recommendations.


###  Tech Stack
* Database: SQL, NeonDB
* Statistics: Z-Test for proportions, Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)
* BI: Power BI 


###  Dataset & Business Context
Source: Kaggle - [Marketing A/B Testing](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faviovaz/marketing-ab-testing)

Scenario: A retail company tested a new ad campaign.
*   Test Group ('ad'): Exposed to the new creative.
*   Control Group ('psa'): Exposed to Public Service Announcements (organic baseline).
Financial Assumptions:
*   Cost per Ad View (CPA): $0.20
*   Subscription/Product Price: $50.00


## Execution & Results


Here are the main questions, the answers to which are the final result:
1. Can the data distribution in the test be trusted?
2. Did the advertising really increase sales, or is it just a coincidence?
3. Is this campaign financially profitable?
4. What can be improved?
